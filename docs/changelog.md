The release involved significant changes, in part to resolve serious accessibility issues. Extensive testing has helped us avoid breaking changes, except in regards to chart/table footer fields:

* _includes/components/charts/chart.html
* _includes/components/indicator/table.html

If you have overridden either to these two files, your chart/table "footer fields" may not display properly. More information on the necessary updates is on the [1.2.0 upgrade instructions](upgrades/upgrading-1-2-0.md).

Most files in the _includes and _layouts folders underwent some change in this release. If you are overriding any of those files, your implementation might not benefit from the various enhancements/fixes in the release.

For details on upgrading from 1.0.0 or higher to 1.2.0, see the [1.2.0 upgrade instructions](upgrades/upgrading-1-2-0.md).

Breaking changes:

This is a major version upgrade and contains some breaking changes. Full technical details are available in [1.0.0 upgrade instructions](upgrades/upgrading-1-0-0.md). But here is a brief summary of the breaking changes:

* This upgrade should be accompanied by an upgrade to:
    * jekyll-open-sdg-plugins 1.0.0
    * sdg-build 1.0.0
    * sdg-translations 1.0.0
* Some global Liquid variables have changed. For example:
    * `t` has changed to `page.t`
    * `meta` has changed to `page.indicator`
    * `current_language` has changed to `page.language`
    * Details on Liquid variables can be found in [the Jekyll customisation docs](jekyll-templates.md).
* The following include files have been removed:
    * indicator-variables.html
    * goal-variables.html
    * multilingual.html
* The following includes files have been moved:
    * data-notice.html
    * fields-template.html
    * indicator-content.html
    * metadata.html
    * sources.html
    * units-template.html
* All include files and layout files in the platform have been updated.
* The `get_indicator_name` filter is no longer supported. Use `sdg_lookup` and hash objects instead. Eg:

        {% assign indicatorId = '1.1.1' %}
        {% assign myIndicator = indicatorId | sdg_lookup %}

        <p>The name of my indicator is: {{ myIndicator.name }}</p>
        <p>My indicator is in goal {{ myIndicator.goal_number }}.</p>

        {% assign myGoal = myIndicator.goal_number | sdg_lookup %}

        <p>The name of my goal is {{ myGoal.name }}.</p>

    For more details see [the Jekyll customisation docs](jekyll-templates.md).

* The `remotedatabaseurl` setting is no longer supported. Use `remote_data_prefix` instead.
* The `custom_css` configuration option is deprecated. Override [the `_sass/custom.scss` file](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/blob/master/_sass/custom.scss) instead.
* The H2 on indicator pages is now controlled by the `indicator_available` metadata field, rather than `graph_title`.
* The expected structure of the `data_start_values` metadata field has changed to be a list of objects, rather than a list of strings. See an [example of using data_start_values](metadata-format.md#starting-values).

* After this change, all sites will need to have jekyll-open-sdg-plugins 0.0.13 or later.
* In addition, if you have overridden any of the following files, check [this diff](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/compare/0.7.0...0.8.0) to see if you need to make any updates to your overriddes:

Breaking changes:

* Rounding of data has been removed by default. For instructions on adding it back, and controlling the behavior, see #212.
* Translation keys for indicators/targets are now expected to be dash-delimited instead of dot-delimited. This means that you should **not** upgrade to this release until you are using SDG Translations [0.6.0](https://github.com/open-sdg/sdg-translations/releases/tag/0.6.0) or higher.
* Data disaggregation translation keys (ie, translations inside a `data.yml` file) are now expected to be case-sensitive matches, and are no longer automatically converted to lowercase.
* In addition, if you have overridden any of the following files, check [this diff](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/compare/0.6.0...0.7.0) to see if you need to make any updates to your overriddes:

* The reporting status page has been refactored, and the following changes will be needed:
    * In the data repository, make sure the order of the `reporting_status` options in your `_prose.yml` file matches the order you would like them to appear on the page. Example [here](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/3f22d5529c1b3084c3b06665a5e2920cff0aff17).
    * In the data repository, make sure you are using at least version 0.3.0 of SDG Build. Example [here](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/55d91b5952b3cd6ca6d1ddc4601354e8acc4c22b).
    * In the site repository, make sure you are pulling in this new data in the `jekyll_get_json` section. Example [here](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg-site-starter/commit/7986def8a1b82f8754f22a69154560ac33374dd3).

* You may also want to create redirects from the old permalinks. Example [here](https://github.com/GSA/sdg-indicators-usa/commit/648c1a9ae037ea22ed65bcf4158f7d1612934d2b) and [here](https://github.com/brockfanning/sdg-indicators/commit/e0093955cdafef93e31847cba61837881ada3e04).
