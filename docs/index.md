<h1>Welcome to the Open SDG community</h1>

[Open SDG](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg) is an open source, free-to-reuse platform for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs). It is built exclusively with open-source libraries and tools and can be hosted and maintained using free services.

Key features include:

* Machine-readable data
* Data visualizations: graphs, data tables, and maps
* Multilingual: already available in the six official UN languages and more, using the [SDG Translations](https://open-sdg.github.io/sdg-translations/) resource
* Fully customisable
