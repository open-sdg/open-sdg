## How did you set up your country platform based on Open SDG?

There were a few steps to set up SDG platform for Kyrgyz Republic. First we prepared Excel tables with SDG data and metadata. The tables with data were converted to SDMX format and then to CSV format. The tables with metadata were converted to MD format. The CSV and MD files were uploaded to GitHub.

## How long did it take to set up the platform?

Setting up the platform took around 2-3 weeks. 

## How do you upload data and metadata into the platform?

First, the metadata were prepared in Excel format and then converted to MD format. Prepared files were uploaded to our data repository on GitHub.

Our staging environment is hosted on GitHub, and our production environment will be hosted on a local server.

## How are support and maintenance managed for the platform?

For now, the Office for National Statistics (UK) is supporting and maintaining the platform.

## What languages is your platform available in?

Today the platform is available in English and Russian (but still draft). We are planning to also have the platform available in Kyrgyz language and improving the Russian language.

## What customisations were added to the Open SDG platform?
•	The SDG targets were added to platform.</br>
•	We are planning to add national SDG indicators and reporting status by responsible ministries and agencies for producing the indicators. 

## What advice and lessons learned could you give to other countries considering using Open SDG?

It is a good open-source and flexible tool. Before you start work, your data and metadata should be prepared in advance.

As it requires time, it will be helpful to have IT specialist, who will work only with platform.
