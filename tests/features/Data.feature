Feature: Data

    As a data provider
    I need to be able to send Open SDG data in desired formats
    So that the platform viewers can see the data as I intended

    Scenario: Missing values still appear in the table, as dashes
        Given I am on "/1-1-1"
        And I wait 2 seconds
        And I click on "the Table tab"
        And I wait 2 seconds
        Then I should see 3 "table value" elements
        And I should not see "undefined" in the "second table value" element
        And I should see "-" in the "second table value" element

    Scenario: Indicators configured as binary charts should appear as Yes/No on tables too
        Given I am on "/2-4-1"
        And I wait 2 seconds
        And I click on "the Table tab"
        And I wait 2 seconds
        Then I should see 2 "table value" elements
        And I should not see "1" in the "first table value" element
        And I should not see "0" in the "second table value" element
        And I should see "Yes" in the "first table value" element
        And I should see "No" in the "second table value" element
